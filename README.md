# MultiUserDrawing
My 1998 Comp Sci dissertation - a client / server Multi User Drawing tool, written in C and Tcl/Tk

This is the source code for my 1998 Computer Science degree disseratation, M.U.D - Multi User Drawing.

I attended St Andrews University, in Fife, Scotland, from 1994 to 1998, doing a bachelor degree in Computer Science. Part of my final year practical project work was to execute a software project - I chose to write a client / server shared drawing tool using the C and Tcl/Tk languages.

The code was written in a bare bones text editor, no IDE's in those days, on a Dec Alpha workstation, using C with GCC and Tcl/Tk 7.6.

I didn't have access to the source code, only a 20 year old printed document. As such, I used my home Epson scanner to scan every page of code and Nuance OmniPage to run OCR and produce the basis for piecing the code together. I then used CygWin on Windows, Code::Blocks and Komodo IDE to rebuild and test.

Works great under CygWin on Windows and is a blast from the past for me! It's funny to see just how things have moved on in the world of programming - languages these days offer so many features, it's hard to understand why I had to implement my own StringToUpper() function!
